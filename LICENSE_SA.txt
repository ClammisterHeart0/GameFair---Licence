GAMEFAIR LICENSE (GF-V1-SA)
Version 1.2 – “Share-Alike”
A Fair-Use-Inspired License for Fanworks, Mods, and Derivative Projects.

Copyright (c) [CURRENT YEAR], [YOUR NAME or PROJECT NAME]

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
PREAMBLE
The GameFair License is a community-driven, ethics-based license created to
protect fan creativity while maintaining respect for the original creators and
their intellectual property (IP). It allows transformative, non-commercial fan
projects such as mods, fangames, and fanfictions, while forbidding exploitative
monetization and misrepresentation of canon. It also encourages mutual tolerance
between fan creators and IP holders.

COPYRIGHT AND ORIGIN NOTICE
Copyright © [CURRENT YEAR], [YOUR NAME or PROJECT NAME]
This license is a derivative work of the MIT License, incorporating its
Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. DEFINITIONS
- “Original Work” — The copyrighted game, story, or media property owned by its
  legal holder.
- “Fan Content” / “Derivative Fan Content” — A transformative, non-commercial
  work inspired by the Original Work, created under fair-use or equivalent
  principles.
- “Fan Creator” — The individual or group producing the Fan Content.
- “Licensor” — The party releasing the Fan Content under this License.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2. NO IP TRANSFER
This License does not grant ownership, rights, endorsement, or control over the
Original Work or its Intellectual Property. All IP rights remain fully with
their lawful owners. The Licensor is not liable for any action taken by an IP
Holder.
> This License does not imply authorization, approval, or endorsement by the
> Original IP Holder.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3. CANON AND NARRATIVE BOUNDARIES
The Fan Creator may not claim, declare, or implement any element of the Fan
Content — including but not limited to storylines, events, characters, timelines,
or lore — as canonical to the Original Work’s universe.
All creative additions, modifications, or reinterpretations are canon only
within the Fan Content itself.
The sole exception is if the Original IP Holder issues explicit written
authorization acknowledging such material as official or canon.
> This clause preserves the creative integrity of both the fan work and the
> original IP.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4. COMMUNITY STATEMENT (Non-Binding)
The GameFair Community and Licensor respectfully request that Original IP
Holders avoid arbitrary or malicious takedowns of fan projects made in good
faith. If removal is necessary, it is requested (not required) that reasonable
advance notice (e.g., 30 days) be provided.
> This section is a moral appeal and shall not be interpreted as a legal
> obligation.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
