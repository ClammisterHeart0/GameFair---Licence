# 📄 The GameFair License (GF-V1) - The Ethical Standard for Fan Content

The GameFair License (GF-V1) is a system of licensing designed for creators of mods, fangames, and fanfictions. It aims to protect the fan community from commercial exploitation while promoting ethical and transparent sharing.

## THE OBLIGATORY ETHICAL CORE (GF BASE RULES)

**ALL GameFair variations (SA, ND, AU, CC) MUST comply with the following rules, without exception:**

| Core Rule | Impact on the Fan Creator |
| :--- | :--- |
| 🛡️ **Mandatory Attribution** | The Fan Creator must give explicit, visible credit to the Original IP Holder. |
| 🚫 **Exploitation Ban** | Content may not be used in projects involving **unauthorized NFTs** or other predatory practices. |
| 🛡️ **Statement of Tolerance** | Includes an ethical clause requesting the Original IP Holder to avoid arbitrary takedowns and provide advance notice. |
| ⛔ **Strict Ban on Sale and Microtransactions** | Fan Content is **strictly non-commercial** and **MAY NOT BE SOLD** as a product. All revenue models like microtransactions, paid DLCs, loot boxes, or subscriptions are prohibited. **The only exception is pure, voluntary, non-essential donations.** |

### ⛔ Exception: The Only Path to Sale Monetization

The Fan Creator **MAY ONLY** transition to monetization by sale if:
1.  **They Remove All Derivative Content:** The creator must remove *all* assets, lore, names, and visual elements that are not original to the fan, making the work a fully original product. **OR**
2.  **They Obtain Explicit Permission:** They receive specific written authorization from the Original IP Holder.
**If either condition is met, the work is no longer governed by the GameFair License.**
